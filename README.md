## Introduction
Mangroves and salt marsh ecotone regions are migrating towards the poles due to climatic changes such as increasing temperatures and shifting salinity regimes. IMPLICATION OF CHANGE. In this analysis, we examine how dominant vegetation type (i.e., marsh or mangroves) influences delta evolution and sediment accretion over a 50 year time period.
